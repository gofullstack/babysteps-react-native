            This is a research study. We are inviting you and your child to
            participate, because your child, who may or may not have behavioral
            or developmental challenges, is 18 months to 3 years old. In this

            The purpose of this research is to better understand how genetics
            and the social environment influence the way children develop.
            Specifically, this study will use a smartphone application and blood
            samples to study potential risk factors for Autism Spectrum Disorder
            or other developmental disorders.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            Researchers will determine your eligibility and will provide you with a link to access
            the BabySteps smartphone application. After you have reviewed the
            BabySteps app, you can press the "Agree" button on the application
            to formally consent to the study, and can sign electronically. You
            and your child cannot participate in this study without giving your
            signed permission. Once the consent form is properly completed,
            you/your child may complete other app-based tasks and in-person
            procedures.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            During this study, each mother-child pair may meet with researchers
            once or twice. If your child has an appointment scheduled at the CDD
            or another University of Iowa clinic, study researchers may meet
            with you shortly before this appointment. A blood draw may be part
            of the standard care for these appointments, and researchers may
            request access to a small amount of the blood that is drawn at that
            time. If your child is not scheduled for a clinical evaluation or
            was scheduled for evaluation but did not have blood drawn at that
            time, researchers will contact you to explain the procedures for a
            blood sample collection for your child. This sample can be collected
            at the CDD by healthcare staff or by you in your home. These blood
            samples will be compared to a sample of blood that was taken when
            your child was born (these samples are obtained from all babies born
            in the state of Iowa). Analyzing the two samples will reveal whether
            chemical ("epigenetic") changes occurred over time.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            Researchers will also orient you to the smartphone application,
            BabySteps, that you will be asked to use for about 6 months. Within
            the app, you will be able to take photos and record special
            milestones. Occasionally, you will be asked to videotape yourself
            playing with your child. You will also complete screening tests or
            questions designed to assess your child's language, motor, and
            cognitive development. Some of these screening tests will assess for
            early signs of autism. Certain results may indicate your child is
            not eligible to continue in this study. If this occurs, you will be
            notified. You are free to continue use of the app if you so choose.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.text}>
            We may ask other questions about your mood, your day-to-day life, or
            your history. You are free to skip any questions that you would
            prefer not to answer. Prompts will appear on your cell phone several
            times per week, and will usually only require a single button press.
            You should try to answer these as soon as you see them. Other
            prompts should take between 1 and 10 minutes to complete on each
            occasion. If any of the information gathered through the app, such
            as information about your well-being or your child's development,
            indicates a need for intervention, you will be referred to
            appropriate providers.

            was assessed in the CDD, we will also obtain information from your

            Data and Blood Storage for Future Use

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            As part of this study, we are obtaining blood samples from your
            child. We and other researchers may wish to study your child’s blood
            samples in the future, after this study is over without further
            consent. These samples, information, and/or data may be placed in a
            central repository or other national repositories sponsored by the
            National Institutes of Health or other Federal agencies. If this
            happens, it may be stripped of identifiers (such as name, date of
            birth, address, etc.). Other qualified researchers who obtain proper
            permission may gain access to your sample and/or data for use in
            approved research studies that may or may not be related to the
            purpose of this study.

            Blood cells removed from the blood samples may be used to make a
            cell line and DNA or conduct whole genome sequencing. Cell lines are
            produced by growing blood cells in a laboratory and allow us to have
            a source of the DNA without having to redraw your blood. These blood
            cells can be stored for decades or more. The DNA and data might be
            made available to researchers trying to learn more about the cause
            of diseases.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.text}>
            Each of the cells in your body contains DNA. DNA is the instruction
            manual that determines your appearance in things like eye color or
            how tall you can be. Your DNA may also lead to higher or lower risk
            of certain diseases. Your environment will also determine some of
            your disease risk.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.text}>
            Your DNA is a string of four building blocks, called “bases.” These
            bases are represented by the letters G, A, T, and C. There are
            billions of these letters strung together in every human’s DNA and
            they are arranged in packages like words. Each of these “words” have
            specific jobs in the body. Most of the time the letters are the same
            in everyone. But about 1% of the population might have an “A” where
            someone else has a “G.” This difference can explain why some people
            have blue eyes and others brown eyes, or why some have a high risk
            for a certain cancer and others a low risk. All these letters come
            together to create your “genome sequence”, a kind of book of your
            genetics. It now possible to read off each of these letters and read
            your complete genome sequence. Your DNA sequence is unique to you.
            You inherit your DNA in almost equal parts from each of your
            parents. In very rare cases, your genome can also change through
            “mutations.” A mutation is like if you tried to copy a page from a
            book, but misspelled some words. Mutations usually result from
            copying errors that occur in certain letters when being passed from
            parent to child.
          </Text>
          <Text style={styles.text}>
            When we take a sample of your child’s blood for this study, it might
            go to a lab to read off those letters and give us a report on your
            child’s genome. This information will then be compared with other
            genomes to see how they may be the same or different. It is our hope
            this will help us to better understand how the human body works
            and/or what causes it to not work well, as when someone has a
            developmental delay or condition.

            The tests we might want to use to study your child’s blood samples
            may not even exist at this time. Therefore, we are asking for your
            permission to store your child’s blood samples so that we can study
            them in the future. These future studies may provide additional
            information that will be helpful in understanding Autism Spectrum
            Disorder, but it is unlikely that what we learn from these studies
            will have a direct benefit to you or your child. It is possible that
            your child’s blood samples might be used to develop products, tests,
            or discoveries that could be patented and licensed. In some
            instances, these may have potential commercial value and may be
            developed by the Investigators, University of Iowa, commercial
            companies, funding organizations, or others that may not be working
            directly with this research team. However, donors of blood samples
            do not retain any property rights to the materials. Therefore, there
            are no plans to provide financial compensation to you should this
            occur.

            Your child’s blood samples will be stored with a code which may be
            linked to your/your child’s identifying information, such as name or

            sample but decide in the future that you would like to have it
            removed from future research, you should contact Lane Strathearn MD

            Another purpose of this study is to look at genes (DNA) and how they
            affect health and disease. Genes are the instruction manual for the
            body. The genes you get from your parents decide what you look like
            and how your body behaves. They can also tell us a person’s risk for
            certain diseases and how they will respond to treatment. We will
            study your child’s DNA by comparing their blood from two different
            points in time to see if chemical (“epigenetic”) changes have
            occurred. Blood test results will not be shared with you or your
            child’s doctor. No one else (like a relative, boss, or insurance
            company) will be given access to these test results.

            Additionally, with your consent, your child’s newborn blood spot may

            Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA)

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            A federal law called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
            (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies,
            group health plans, and employers of 15 or more persons to
            discriminate against you based on your genetic information. Based on
            this new law, health insurance companies and group health plans are
            prohibited from requesting your genetic information that we get from
            this research. This means that they may not use your genetic
            information when making decisions regarding your eligibility for
            insurance coverage or the amount of your insurance premiums. Be
            aware that this new federal law will not protect you against genetic
            discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability
            insurance, or long-term care insurance. The law also does not
            prohibit discrimination if you are already known to have a genetic
            disease or disorder.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
            (HIPAA) requires your child's healthcare provider to obtain your
            permission for the research team to access or create “protected
            health information” about your child for purposes of this research
            study. Protected health information is information that personally
            identifies your child and relates to your child's past, present, or
            future physical or mental health condition or care. We will access
            or create health information about your child, as described in this
            document, for purposes of this research study. Once your child's
            healthcare provider has disclosed your child's protected health
            information to us, it may no longer be protected by the Federal
            HIPAA privacy regulations, but we will continue to protect your
            child's confidentiality as described under “Confidentiality.”

            Your child cannot participate in this study unless you permit us to
            use your child's protected health information. If you choose not to
            allow us to use your child's protected health information, we will
            discuss any non-research alternatives available to your child. Your
            decision will not affect your child's right to medical care that is
            not research-related. Your signature on this Consent Document
            authorizes your child's healthcare provider to give us permission to
            use or create health information about you and your child.

            permission for us to access or create protected health information
            about your child for purposes of this study has no expiration date.
            You may withdraw your permission for us to use your child's health

            Dr. Lane Strathearn, 100 Hawkins Dr., 213F CDD, Iowa City, IA 52242.
            However, we may still use your child's health information that was

            your child's health information to a third party, such as the study

            may not be possible to prevent its future use. You will receive a
